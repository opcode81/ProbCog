# configuration script for the MLN query & parameter learning tools
#
#   If you want to use PyMLNs with the Alchemy System (http://alchemy.cs.washington.edu),
#   set the path where it is installed on your system in the alchemy_versions dictionary below.
#
#   Depending on your naming convention for mln and database files, you may need to change
#      query_db_filemask, query_mln_filemask, learnwts_mln_filemask and learnwts_db_filemask
#   to suit your needs.
#
#   You can use os.getenv("VARIABLE") to retrieve the value of an environment variable

# snapshot, snapshot original and (if the weights in the input MLN are all 0) all yield the same results when weight learning
# snapshot is a lot faster than snapshot original though
# snapshot learnwts-startpnt modifies the start point of the optimization, using the weights given in the mln (if any) instead of a zero vector - these weights are not used as priors for penalizing though (reset to 0)
# snapshot dev has a different counting method (which I think is correct - unlike the original one)
