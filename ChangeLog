1.2.0  (unreleased)
	* MLNs (Python)
		- Cleaned up differentiation between mrf & mln, fixing remaining references
		- Grounding
			* Modularisation of grounding methods to support 
			* Added custom grounding method for BPLL/WCSP
			* Fixed grounding of EXIST
			* Added grounding method where ground formulas are not collected but can be iterated on demand
		- Learning
			* Made BPLL more efficient and more memory-efficent 
			* Added new learning method BPLL_CG based on custom grounding
			* Fixed numeric issues in PLL
			* Added learning method DBPLL (discriminative pseudologlikelihood with blocking)
			* Added learning method DPLL_ISE_ME (discriminative pseudologlikelihood learning with independent soft evidence, memory-efficent)
			* Fixed MultipleDatabaseLearner (was broken by explicit closed-world assumption just prior to v1.0 release)
			* Fixed Gaussian prior
		- Inference
			* Fixed handling of soft evidence in EnumerationAsk
		- Logic
			* Handle corner case where no clauses remain in Conjunction.toCNF
		- Databases
			* Optimised reading of databases with large domains or a large number of soft evidence items
			* Allow to instantiate databases directly from string content
	* Datagen (Python)
		- Fixed SelN
	* SRLDB (Java)
		- Fixed auto-detection of Boolean domains for MLN database generation
	* BLNs (Java)
		- Allow BLNLearner and BLNinfer to be more conveniently parametrised/configured 
		- Fixed support for logical variables appearing in hard constraints
	* Logging under Java: Added PrintLogger to unify console output and logging for stand-alone and library usage
	* MLNs (Java)
		- Inference
			* Applied PrintLogger in SampleSAT/MaxWalkSAT and 
			* Added time-limited mode to Toulbar2 inference
			* MaxWalkSAT
				- Use specific negation mode prior to CNF conversion in order to avoid splits at conjunctions where possible
				- Optimisations to avoid unnecessary iterations over the set of constraints
	* Switched to Maven-based build, altering directory structure
